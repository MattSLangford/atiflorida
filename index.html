					<h3>About</h3>
					<p>Automation Technology, Inc. (ATI) is a supplier of industrial instrumentation and related products. We provide engineering assistance in regard to identifying the correct instruments for the measurement and control of anything related to pressure, temperature, level and flow. Industrial instrumentation includes, but is not limited to, such things as analyzers, valves, gauges, pumps, vacuum products, test equipment and such like. Related products literally consist of everything else – we have supplied tapes, adhesives, gloves, basic MRO items, surveillance systems, computer monitors and such like.</p>
					<p>Having supported the Department of Energy and Department of Defense through the supply of such products to site operating Prime Contractors for over 40 years, has allowed ATI to develop and maintain an efficient system of supplying product accurately and in a timely manner. Consistently meeting challenges of expedited delivery schedules, locating hard-to-find items and navigating the current supply chain disruption with effective results.</p>
					<p>As a Native-American owned, Small Business concern, we are committed to meeting the needs of our customers on a daily basis. We are willing to pursue the locating and supply of those items others may deem “too difficult or not profitable enough” – we understand and are committed to bringing long term value to our relationships. Those “too difficult or not profitable enough” items are still needed by our customers and over the long term, other opportunities will arise that are not “too difficult or profitable enough” and our efforts on the smaller requirements are generally rewarded.</p>
